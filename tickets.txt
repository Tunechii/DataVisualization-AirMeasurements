 3. Pollution Map Enhancements

Goal: Make the map analytical.

Ideas:

Add a legend (color scale from green → red).

Allow toggling pollutant layers (CO, NO₂, O₃) using radio buttons.

Circle size proportional to pollution intensity.

Tooltip on hover: “Athens – 432 µg/m³ (O₃)”

Library: Leaflet.js already supports this easily.
